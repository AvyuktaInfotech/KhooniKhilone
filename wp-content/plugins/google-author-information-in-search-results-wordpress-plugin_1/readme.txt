Replaces the author link with your Google+ Profile Link or adds a special link after every blogpost

== Description ==

I've built another easy and free wordpress plugin. It will help you to integreate a special link into your posts and pages so that Google can match your content with your Google+ Profile. Once this is done your profile picture will appear in Googles search results.
Please note: Google says that there is no guarantee that a Rich Snippet will be shown for your page on actual search results.

A) Set up authorship by linking your content to your Google+ profile  
 
* Create a Google+ Profile (http://plus.google.com/Plus)
* Follow this link to open your Google+ profile: http://plus.google.com/me
* Copy your Profile-URL from the address bar to clipboard
* Go to your Wordpress Admin Panel and click Users » Your Profile. Paste the above mentioned URL to the field where it says „Google Plus Author Link“.
* Click Update Profile.
* Repeat the above steps with all the other Wordpress authors on your blog.

B) Add a reciprocal link back from your profile to the site you just updated

* Follow this link to edit the Contributor To section: http://plus.google.com/me/about/edit/co
* In the dialog that appears, click Add custom link, and then enter your website URL.
* If you want, click the drop-down list to specify who can see the link.
* Click Save.

C) Test

* To see what author data Google can extract from your page, use the Rich Snippet Testing Tool.

D) Need more options?

* If you need more options, why not using the [extended edition](http://bit.ly/Wn88bZ) of this plugin?
